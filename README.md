# LanguagePatterns

Here are some useful language patterns. [Basic parsing patterns](#Basic-Parsing-Patterns:) are some frequently used patterns. And [high level parsing patterns](#High-Level-Parsing-Patterns:) include some difficult ways to analysis complex language. I strongly suggest you to read Terence Parr's Create Your Own Domain-Specifiic and General Programming Languages. I learn a lot. But if you read, this repo may not useful for you.

## Basic Parsing Patterns:

- [x] LL(1) recursive descendent lexer
        
    package Lexer
- [x] LL(1) recursive descendent syntax parsing
        
    package Recursive_descent
- [ ] LL(k) recursive descendent syntax parsing



## High Level Parsing Patterns:
